I. File Structure
-----------------

    include/ - interfaces for library functions, only modules are intended to
        access them

    so/ - archives and shared objects used by modules in linking stage

    lib_dir/ - asm/ assembly implementations
             - src/ C implementations

    Makefile - build sources from lib_dirs using a template Makefile which can
        be found in /scripts/ and links the resulting objects in different
        shared objects and archives which can be found in so/
