I. File structure
-----------------

A. Root directory
-----------------

Here shall be found the following files and directories:

    iso       - GRUB directory that is used for emulation

    kmain.c   - kernel source code

    loader.s  - entry point in the OS that passes execution to kernel

    m*/       - directories starting with 'm' shall contain modules that 
        combined in kmain provide functionality for the OS

    config/   - folder for config files

    Documentation.txt - file that describes important aspects about the
        structure, implementation, functionality, etc

    README.md - brief explanation of the project

    Makefile  - makefile to build the whole project

Makefile rules:

    all - recursively build all modules and combine them to get the kernel

    run - run the OS in bochs emulator

    clean - clean unimportant files (objects, executables, etc)

B. Module directories
---------------------

In a module shall be found the following files and directories:

    include/ - header files that declare the functionality of the module 

    src/     - source files that implement the functionality of the module

    header file - this file interfaces the whole module and can be accessed
        kernel's source code

    Documentation.txt - file that describes important aspects about the module

    Makefile - makefile to build an object file used by the kernel
