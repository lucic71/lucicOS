I. File structure
-----------------

A. Root directory
-----------------

File structure
--------------

    iso       - GRUB directory that is used for emulation

    kmain.c   - kernel source code

    loader.s  - entry point in the OS that passes execution to kernel

    modules/  - list of modules, each module is kept in a different directory

    config/   - folder for config files

    scripts/  - useful scripts and templates

    Documentation.txt - file that describes important aspects about the
        structure, implementation, functionality, etc

    README.md - brief explanation of the project

    Makefile  - makefile to build the whole project

Makefile rules
--------------

    all - recursively build all modules and combine them to get the kernel

    run - run the OS in bochs emulator

    clean - clean unimportant files (objects, executables, etc)

B. Module directories
---------------------

File structure
--------------

    include/ - interfaces for modules

    module_dir/ - implementation of module. Each module must have a short
        description of what it does and a Makefile that will describe what
        libraries it uses and other important configuration
